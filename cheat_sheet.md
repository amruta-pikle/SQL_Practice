## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Joins

| Join Type     | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| üîó INNER JOIN | Only matching rows from both tables               |
| üîó LEFT JOIN  | All rows from left + matches from right           |
| üîó RIGHT JOIN | All rows from right + matches from left           |
| üîó FULL JOIN  | All rows from both tables, matched where possible |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ GROUP BY & HAVING

```sql
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Subqueries & CTEs

**Subquery:**

```sql
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**CTE:**

```sql
WITH dept_avg AS (
  SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_avg d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > d.avg_salary;
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Window Functions

| Function         | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ROW\_NUMBER()    | Sequential numbering per partition |
| RANK()           | Ranking with gaps for ties         |
| DENSE\_RANK()    | Ranking without gaps for ties      |
| SUM()/AVG() OVER | Running totals / moving averages   |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
FROM employees;
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Indexing & Performance

```sql
-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_dept ON employees(dept_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON employees(dept_id, salary);

-- Check performance
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 10;
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions & Isolation Levels

```sql
-- Transaction commands
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE emp_id = 101;
COMMIT;   -- or ROLLBACK;
```

| Isolation Level  | Prevents                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| READ UNCOMMITTED | Dirty reads not prevented             |
| READ COMMITTED   | Prevents dirty reads                  |
| REPEATABLE READ  | Prevents dirty & non-repeatable reads |
| SERIALIZABLE     | Prevents all anomalies (slowest)      |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Tips

* Avoid `SELECT *` in production queries.
* Use CTEs for **readability** in complex queries.
* Use window functions instead of self-joins for ranking or running totals.
* Index wisely ‚Üí improves SELECT but may slow INSERT/UPDATE.
* Prefer `NOT EXISTS` over `NOT IN` when subquery might contain NULLs.
